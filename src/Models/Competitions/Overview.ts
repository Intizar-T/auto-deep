  Palmer (n√©e Wells)[9] and civil engineer John Christopher Depp.[10][11] Depp's family moved frequently during his childhood, eventually settling in 
  Miramar, Florida, in 1970.[12] His parents divorced in 1978 when he was 15,[12][13] and his mother later married Robert Palmer, whom Depp has called 
  "an inspiration".[14][15]`,
  topic: ` Depp's mother gave him a guitar when he was 12, and he began playing in various bands.[12] He dropped out of Miramar High School at 16 in 1979 to become 
a rock musician. He attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician.[12] In 1980, 
Depp began playing in a band called The Kids. After modest local success in Florida, the band moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing 
its name to Six Gun Method. In addition to the band, Depp worked a variety of odd jobs, such as in telemarketing. In December 1983, Depp married makeup 
artist Lori Anne Allison,[7] the sister of his band's bassist and singer. The Kids split up before signing a record deal in 1984, and Depp began
 collaborating with the band Rock City Angels.[16] He co-wrote their song "Mary", which appeared on their debut Geffen Records album Young Man's 
 Blues.[17] Depp and Allison divorced in 1985.[7]`,
  explanation: `Depp is of primarily English descent, with some French, German, and Irish ancestry.[18] His surname comes from a French Huguenot immigrant, Pierre 
Dieppe, who settled in Virginia around 1700. In interviews in 2002 and 2011, Depp claimed to have Native American ancestry, saying: "I guess I have 
some Native American somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American. She grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. 
Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek Indian".[19] Depp's claims came under scrutiny when Indian Country`,

  eligibility: `Today wrote that Depp had never inquired about his heritage or been recognized as a member of the Cherokee Nation.[20] This led to criticism from the
 Native American community, as Depp has no documented Native ancestry,[20] and Native community leaders consider him "a non-Indian"[20][21] and a 
 pretendian.[22][23][24] Depp's choice to portray Tonto, a Native American character, in The Lone Ranger was criticized,[20][21] along with his choice 
 to name his rock band "Tonto's Giant Nuts".[25][26][27][28] During the promotion for The Lone Ranger, Depp was formally adopted as an honorary son by
  LaDonna Harris, a member of the Comanche Nation, making him an honorary member of her family but not a member of any tribe.[29][30] Depp's Comanche 
  name given at the adoption was "Mah Woo May", which means shape shifter.[31] Critical response to his claims from the Native community increased 
  after this, including satirical portrayals of Depp by Native comedians.[26][27][28] An ad featuring Depp and Native American imagery, by Dior for 
  the fragrance "Sauvage", was pulled in 2019 after being accused of cultural appropriation and racism.[32][33][34][35][29]`,
